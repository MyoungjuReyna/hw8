        <h3>Q. Without using relative or absolute positioning,<br><br> what is another way to organize elements on a page?<br><br>
         - Answer : Float </h3>
        <p>The float element is very useful to incorporate an image with a block of text.  As the web designer you can decide to float the image to the left or to the right.</p>

        <h3>Q. Why I chose the colors?</h3>
        <p> I found these color combination from Color Hunt. I wanted to make green as a background. It's because Green was the predominant color in the forest, so the color green has a restful effect. In addition, green makes people feel comfortable and relieves their stress. Yellow and green are complementary colours, so the effect is striking. And the pink is also one of comeplementary color. In a short, the reason that I chose these color combination is that I wanted to emphasize the calm and necessary parts of the site.</p>
